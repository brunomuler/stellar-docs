    <h1>How user-to-user cross-border payments work on Stellar</h1>
  </header>
  <div>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Laura in the USA wants to send money to Victor in Brazil.</li>

      <li>Both Laura and Victor already have digital wallets they use to store, transfer, and trade Stellar-network tokens.</li>

      <li>Laura wants to send her local currency, USD, but Victor wants to receive his local currency, BRL. </li>

      <li>The following diagram shows how that payment – which involves 2 users, 2 wallets, and 2 anchors – unfolds on Stellar.</li>

      <li>It assumes both wallets and both anchors support SEP-6 and SEP-12.  The anchor to wallet interactions are all handled via API.</li>
      </li>
